deliverables:
plot.sh: should produce monte carlo method plots
approach: investigate monte-carlo's outputs. Is there a way to write x and y to a file and input into gnuplot? Isolate points inside circle to one file. Ones outside to a diff file? Graph files to same plot in different colors.
monte-carlo.c: provided. ex: ./monte-carlo -n 10
Makefile: provided. Study. Directs compilation process.
README.md: markdown. how to use script & makefile. what options plot.sh accepts
DESIGN.pdf: describe design & process. pseudocode and diagrams
Writeup.pdf: plots. which commands used in plot.sh and why.

what is a makefile?
when a makefile is in a folder, if you type in make, it will perform what the makefile is set to do
approach:
first test what monte_carlo.c outputs, see how I can acquire the x and y values.
put x and y values into a .dat file for gnuplot.
if circle = 1 or 0, then make dot red or blue
input .dat file into gnuplot using a .sh script that outputs a pdf image

can't isolate the x y values themselves
dump output in a file, then parse file for x and y values?
from full bash guide:
ex:
IFS=<separation symbol> read -ra <array_name> << "string or file"
(IFS definition: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/IFS. input field separator. special variable. read command tells it to split the input. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/209123/understanding-ifs-read-r-line)
start with taking all input and putting it into an array, the input will consist of something like
"   0   0   0.9     0.1 1"
start with checking the final char of each line, is it 1 or 0? sort into separate arrays of in circle and not in circle
while parsing through the array, divide each line into it's own array, select elements 2 and 3 and write to a .dat file
pseudocode:
grab input from monte monte_carlo
separate output by \n into file_array
while not at end of file_array, separate each into an array of its own by spaces,
put x and y elements into a .dat file
when finsihed with loop, start up gnuplot and plot using .dat file
