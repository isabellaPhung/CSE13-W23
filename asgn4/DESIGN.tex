\section{Introduction}
\section{Pseudocode}
Unvierse.h has been provided by the CSE13S instructors as a guideline for how to structure the Universe.c file.
Life.c: Will require accepting string user input. Admittedly unsure how to do that. I believe I have to do this using getchar, however I don't know the best approach for creating a list of chars for something of unknonw length. I will also have to keep in mind exception handling in regards to this. If the user types in a space, this gets viewed differently in the file explorer from the user. The same goes for outputing a file, if the user attempts to input a space, slash, percent character, these will all interfere with creating a output file. Handling the input and output will not be done with a set, but instead with a few variables since there aren't a lot of user input options. 
Beyond that, this program will be the driver of this libarary. It will call the uv\textunderscore populate function to create the universe, then run uv\textunderscore census multiple times for the number of generations. It will also handle the ncursor output, which will require some fiddling to get working. \\
Universe.c:\\
Constructor: create matrix of indicated width and height of booleans to represent the universe. Bits will be allocated, in the event the allocation failes, I intend on using assert to crash the program.\\
Destructer: deallocate all boolean values and set pointers to null.
uv\textunderscore rows: will return rows of universe.
uv\textunderscore cols: will return number of columns of universe.
uv\textunderscore live\textunderscore cell: changes cell to true.
uv\textunderscore dead\textunderscore cell: changes cell to false.
uv\textunderscore get\textunderscore cell: returns state of cell
uv\textunderscore populate: parses given file using infile and fscanf. First two items are row and height, can then call constructor to build matrix. Can then call uv\textunderscore live\textunderscore on following lines to populate the universe until the end of the file.Returns true if universe is successful. In the event that the population fails, I'm admittedly unsure if the constructor should handle that or if this function should handle it too.
uv\textunderscore census: This function is the critical aspect for the entire game to work. Firstly the rules indicated by the Conway are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Live cells with 2-3 live neighbors survive.
    \item Dead cells w/ 3 neighbors becomes live.
    \item All other cells die.
\end{enumerate}
This function's role is to return the number of live cells surrounding a cell. First, check that the requested cell is a valid cell. For any cell with coordinates [a, b], its neighbors will follow the following format: top [a, b+1], right [a+1, b], bottom [a, b-1], left [a-1, b]. 
For a flat universe, if the cell is located at the edge of the universe, then the necessary neighbor will not be taken into account as it does not exist within the universe. The diagram below illustrates this concept:

Although a toroid universe may seem intimidating, it isn't too difficult. In the event the cell is located at the edge of the universe, then the corresponding neighbor follows this logic tree, assuming the cell has the coordinates [a, b] and the size of the universe is n by n.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If column equals n-1 (right edge of universe), right neighbor is [a, 0]
    \item If column equals 0 (left edge of universe), left neighbor is [a, n-1]
    \item If row equals n-1 (bottom edge of universe), bottom neighbor is [0, b]
    \item if row equals 0 (top edge of universe), top neighbor is [n-1, b]
\end{itemize}
There are some edge cases that may or may not have to addressed by this function or the populate function. For example, what do we do if we have an extremely small torodial function? Can a cell be its own neighbor?
uv\textunderscore print: parses through universe, uses uv\textunderscore get to check if cell is dead or alive and prints o for alive, . for dead.
